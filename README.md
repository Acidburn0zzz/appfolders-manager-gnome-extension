# Appfolders-Manager (GNOME extension)
A GNOME extension allowing easy management of "appfolders" directly from the application view.

Please notice that for now, javascript files are just here for the user interface : everything is done by the "appfolders-editor" bash script, which can be used as a standalone script for (more complete) appfolders management.
