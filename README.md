(version 2)

(english/french/greek/italian/polish)

### Version 1
Features :
* Create new appfolders (ugly & buggy submenu)
* Add applications to folders (ugly submenu)
* Remove applications from folders (ugly submenu)
* Delete appfolders (not a total deletion)

Install it from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1217/appfolders-manager/

There is a few bugs, it works but don't try foolish things with it.

### Version 2 (beta)
Features :
* Create new appfolders (cool dialog entry)
* Add applications to folders (cool submenu with only pertinent items)
* Remove applications from folders (cool submenu with only pertinent items)
* Delete appfolders (optionnally, a total deletion)
* Set the maximum number of columns (GNOME Shell's default is 6)

This version is not perfect, I'm aware of most bugs (see what i write in [that issue](https://github.com/Maestroschan/appfolders-manager-gnome-extension/issues/2) which i often edit).

Manual installation :
* Download the .zip archive and extract files in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/appfolders-manager@maestroschan.fr`
* Restart Gnome Shell.
* Activate the extension.
